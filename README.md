## LaserLights

### Background and Overview

LaserLights is an interactive sandbox game that lets you set up mirrors, shine lasers, and create cool patterns with the reflections.

Choose different colors, turn on the lasers, and watch your designs come to life!


### Functionality and MVP

In LaserLights, users will be able to:
- [ ] Add lasers of different colors
- [ ] Add mirrors of different shapes
- [ ] Add prisms to split/combine colors
- [ ] Move and rotate each of the objects

In addition, this project will include:
- [ ] An About modal providing some information about laser technology
- [ ] A button to "turn out the lights" to give the laser patterns more contrast

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

* Vanilla JavaScript for object and math logic
* CSS for styling
* `HTML5 Canvas` for rendering

- [ ] Get webpack running to serve the HTML and JavaScript
- [ ] Create sprites/representations of each object

#### Day 2:
- [ ] Create classes for each object (lasers, mirrors, prisms)
- [ ] Create parent class for duplicate functionality

#### Day 3:
- [ ] Add interactivity to the objects (rotatable, movable)
- [ ] Implement mirror reflection, and the math that goes along with it

#### Day 4:
- [ ] Implement prism logic (color splitting/combining)
- [ ] Polish CSS
- [ ] Add dark mode
- [ ] Include About information

### Bonus Features
- [ ] Add a Game Mode to complement the Sandbox Mode
- [ ] Add more challenging levels
- [ ] Introduce some new items (not sure yet)
